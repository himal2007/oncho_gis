## Welcome to my GitHub Page for geospatial modelling for onchocerciasis

I will update my progress on creating a geospatially explicity model for a disease called Onchocerciasis. This disease is commonly known as "river blindness" because of it's occurence in the communities near river. This causes debilitating illness which include blindness. For more information on Onchocerciasis, visit [this page](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/onchocerciasis).
