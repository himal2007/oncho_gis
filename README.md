# oncho_gis
Files related to geospatial modelling of _O. volvulus_ infection prevalence in Ethiopia.

The repository consists of the markdown files/codes for the following aspects of the analysis:

1. Exploring prevalence and the environmental data including initial selection of the environmental variables - [Workbook 1](https://github.com/himal2007/oncho_gis/blob/master/codes/1.-explore_data.md)

2. Comparing different distributions for model fitting, selection of triangulation meshes, final selection of environmental variables and K-fold cross validation of the candidate models - [Workbook 2](https://github.com/himal2007/oncho_gis/blob/master/codes/2.-model_selection_n_fitting.md)

3. Running the best model and visualising the model prediction - [Workbook 3](https://github.com/himal2007/oncho_gis/blob/master/codes/3_run_best_model_n_predict.md)
